  <h1>Terms of Agreement</h1>

  <p>These Terms of Agreement apply to all listings on the CacheValleySearch.com&trade; internet directory (or any successor internet directory) (&ldquo;Internet Directory&rdquo;). </p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Publication of Listing.</strong> Media  Perfection, L.C. (Company) authorizes Listings on its  Website in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  By accepting this Agreement you request Company to publish your Listing on the Internet  Directory. &nbsp;Company  may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these terms and conditions and  Company&rsquo;s policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications  or revisions.</li>

<li><strong>Payment Terms. </strong>You promise to pay Company the monthly fee  based upon the applicable plan as the same may be amended from time to time,  plus all state and local taxes attributable thereto. In the event you have  requested a recurring payment structure, you hereby authorize the relevant credit  card company or bank and any third party automated payment/debit service  utilized by Company to automatically make payments to Company and charge/debit  your applicable account on a recurring basis for the amount of the payment.  Such authorization will remain in effect until 30 days following Company's  receipt of your written notice of termination of such authorization. You agree  to notify Company promptly of any change in your billing address. You hereby  authorize Company to perform such initial and periodic investigations of your  credit history as Company deems necessary or desirable in making a decision on  whether to extend credit to you from time to time.&nbsp; Extension of credit and approval for any  payment program is contingent on Company&rsquo;s determination, in the exercise of  its sole discretion, that the results of the credit investigation are  satisfactory. Company may require advance payment in full prior to the  publication of any Advertising or the provision of any Service.&nbsp; Interest shall accrue on all amounts not paid  by the due date at a rate of 1.5% per month or the highest rate allowed by  applicable law, whichever is lower.
